## ianconnolly/slides

This is a collection of the slides I've put together for various talks that I give. 

So far, various talks have been given to:

* The Dublin University Computer Science Society, [DUCSS](http://ducss.ie "DUCSS")
* UCD Entrepreneurs &amp; Investors Society
* [air.mozilla.org](http://air.mozilla.org)


All are built using the great [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js "reveal.js") library and hosted on GitHub Pages.
