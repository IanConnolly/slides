## ianconnolly/slides

This is a collection of the slides I've put together for various talks that I give. 
So far, they've only been given to the Dublin University Computer Science Society, [DUCSS](http://ducss.ie "DUCSS")


All are built using the great [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js "reveal.js") library and hosted on GitHub Pages.
